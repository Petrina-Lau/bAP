# bAP  
dendritic back-propagation analysis brain wide

Steps:
1 - reproduce analysis from Hausser lab in S1, where neuropixel recording is tailored for dendritic recording

2 - expand the analysis to IBL BWM dataset in comparable regions

3 - associate behavioural, tasks and internal states with bAP in selected regions, especially in mismatch events

4 - expand the analysis to other brain regions in BWM

5 - use open datasets in ground truth juxta-/intra- cellular recording to invetigate cellular activation and dAP relationship

6 - spatial wrapping to counter-act dendriti structure moving out of the recording field, 
    may be with Thy-1 histology to estimate dendritic structure angles brain-wide

7 - apply the analysis to open source human neuropixel recording
